# Tefor, an online replacement for Tithree

This is a browser altered version of an app which serves as an aid for a tutor 🧑‍🏫 It tallies how much time ⏰ is spent with students and how much money 💸 is earned based on that.

Made with **Laravel**, motivated by my beloved 💝. _⚓ Also powered by Shipyard ⚓_.

## Features
- 🧑‍🎓 managing student data
- ✏️ writing sessions' duration and value
- 📈 tallying money and time, and neat plots
- ⚙️ customisable colors
- 📅 Google Calendar integration (limited but working!) //todo? will it work?

## Screenshots
